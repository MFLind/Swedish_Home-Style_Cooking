A cozy and authentic Swedish eatery. We believe in serving traditional and 
home-style Swedish cuisine, made with only the freshest and highest quality 
ingredients.

Our menu is inspired by classic Swedish dishes that have been passed down from generation to generation. From the hearty and filling meatballs with mashed potatoes and lingonberry sauce, to the light and fresh gravad lax (cured salmon) with crisp bread and mustard sauce, there is something for everyone at our restaurant.

Come and join us for a taste of Sweden. Whether you're looking for a romantic dinner for two, a family gathering, or a group celebration, our warm and friendly atmosphere will make you feel right at home.

We look forward to serving you soon!</span><div class=e115_155><div class=e11_28><span  class="ei11_28_1303_449">Home</span></div><div class=e11_32><span  class="ei11_32_1303_449">Menu</span></div><div class=e11_34><span  class="ei11_34_1303_449">Booking</span></div></div></div>
